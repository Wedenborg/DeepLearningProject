# MASTERFILE WITH RESULTS
The file MasterCode.ipynb is the Jupyter notebook that recreates the main results of the report. The file Leaf + PCA contains the baseline models.

# SUPPORTING FILES
All other files are supporting files. The majority are test files for the different parameter tests and file test. Files labeled 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 and 6.1 (pre-fix) are from the course 02456 Deep Learning, DTU Compute, Fall 2019. Files ex11_4_1.py and toolbox_02450.py is from the course 02450 Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Mining, DTU Compute, Fall 2018. 

# NOTE
Data is classified, so data files are not available in the repository. Thus, the files cannot be re-run without the data files (the notebooks are pre-run).
